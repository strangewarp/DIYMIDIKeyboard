Code for building a DIY MIDI keyboard, out of a reclaimed keyboard (or other keys/buttons of some sort) and simple parts. Still under development.This could be used to build a MIDI controller out of any grid of buttons or keys, up to the limit supported by free pins. I may add in shift-register capabilities later, to make this system plausibly compatible with the smaller Arduinos as well.This project is inspired by certain methods used in https://github.com/toroidal-code/Midi-Keyboard - thank you!Also, special thanks for the EEPROM save/load method written by users "footswitch" and "Joghurt" on this page: http://playground.arduino.cc//Code/EEPROMLoadAndSaveSettings
